              In order to fight the challenges of pollution, traffic, and
              population increase, cities will need better transportation
              options. To solve this we’ve implemented a convenient
              transportation app that connects drivers and passengers that are
              going the same direction via pre-arranged or on-the-fly means. Our
              solution provides the ease of ride-hailing apps while being as
              efficient as public transportation.

                    <h3>Osama Kergaye</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                      My name is Osama, pronounced ooo-sam-ah but I often go by
                      Sam for simplicity. I earned a degree in Computer Science
                      with a GPA in the top 7%. I have done personal research in
                      the education space that I hope transitions to market one
                      day. I have also worked on two research projects in
                      different scientific disciplines, further growing my
                      skills and love of R&D. Ride Surfer, my capstone project
                      was possibly a great idea but was quite a lot of work and
                      fun to create. Beyond that, I enjoy the outdoors, things
                      like skiing, backpacking, camping, offroading and the
                      like. However, I also enjoy the indoors, reading, gaming,
                      cooking and watching Netflix; you know the usual. But at
                      my core, I am a scientist and explorer, if I could live a
                      life as a traveling research and development scientist. My
                      experience in this would be complete, and I could not wish
                      for a better life. But that would be for a life of
                      leisure, and lazy is not sexy. That said, If I could
                      achieve one thing in this world, it would be to leave a
                      positive mark in history that was so significant, the
                      world would change for the better forever. As far as my
                      professors and I could figure, modernizing the education
                      system in place today, may achieve that end.

                    <p class="text-muted">
                      My first experience with programming was in 9th grade,
                      when I began adding PHP to the website I was building.
                      Since then I've been insatiably learning and building
                      technologies from all areas of Computer Science. From
                      high-throughput Key/Value stores to CSS Flexbox, whatever
                      area it's in, chances are I have approximate knowledge of
                      it. I've been working in industry for longer than I've
                      been at the U. First at Vivint.SmartHome working on
                      distributed filesystems, web backends, and complex
                      React.js Web Apps. This summer I had the opportunity to
                      internship at Facebook, where I added hot-reload
                      functionality to a FUSE-based NFS client written in C++.
                      Ask me about my many projects, including a multiplayer
                      HTML5 canvas game, programming language with lexer, parser
                      & interpreter, Wednesday Bot, and a perfect AI for tic tac
                      toe. I am an active member of the Triangle Fraternity of
                      Engineers, Architects, and Scientists. After graduation, I
                      hope to take a long bath, go on vacation with my
                      girlfriend, and then launch into a rewarding career of
                      building reliable, useful, beautiful software.

                    <p class="text-muted">
                      Rachel Brough – I have enjoyed attending the University of
                      Utah on an Academic Scholarship. I am graduating with a
                      Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I love learning
                      and exploring new areas of computer science. My interests
                      currently lie in security and web, but I also am
                      interested in solving issues related to transportation and
                      automated driving. During my senior year, my team created
                      a transportation mobile application using React Native
                      that connects passengers and drivers going in similar
                      directions. I worked for 2 years at L3 Technologies
                      writing software to help engineers improve efficiency in
                      the testing department. I received an L3 Bronze
                      Achievement Award for my quick learning and for exceeding
                      expectations. Outside of school, I love to read, watch TV,
                      explore and discuss gender studies, and play the drums.
                      After graduation, I plan to spend more time with my cats
                      and teach them how to debug my code. I hope to be able to
                      use my skills to help and improve my own life and the
                      lives of others.

                    <p class="text-muted">
                      Thuy (“twee”) Nguyen (“when”) – I love programming, math,
                      business, and photography. After spending 18 hours a day
                      for 8 whole days designing and programming my version of
                      Tetris, I knew that not only am I passionate about
                      programming but I can excel at it! I am the first person
                      in my family to attend college – this was my dream ever
                      since I was a little girl growing up in a very poor but
                      hardworking family. Climbing the rigorous academic and
                      career mountain was a challenging, sweat-and-tear laden
                      journey that helped me build integrity, faith, resilience
                      and compassion. Studying Computer Science at the
                      University of Utah and Salt Lake Community College helped
                      me both obtain and succeed at my internships at Fidelity
                      Investments, Disney and Microsoft. After graduation, I
                      will be actively engaged in the University of Utah’s
                      Global Entrepreneurship Program in Nice, France, which
                      includes applying my business and software engineering
                      knowledge in an internship with a startup company.
                      Afterwards, I will be working as a full-time software
                      engineer at Microsoft. My family and I are very grateful
                      for the opportunities I will have as a college-educated
                      professional, and I am excited for my future as a
                      technologist. I hope to create an amazing, impactful
                      product which serves both our local and global
                      communities. Please follow my LinkedIn page for more
                      details on my experiences and skills. Keep connected!

                      Ride Surfer is a mobile application, written in TypeScript
                      using the React Native framework. It communicates with a
                      Node.js backend and uses a PostgreSQL database as a
